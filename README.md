# NightmareEscape
Game built with Unity as personal project for the Create With Code Course

## Basic Game Overview
The player character has found themselves trapped in a nightmare and must fight or avoid nightmare creatures while searching for the exit
to wake up.

Player will have a light following that illuminates their surroundings, no other sources of light are available.
Game has a fear mechanic that functions similarly to sanity mechanics in Lovecraftian games - if the player reaches 100% fear 
(equivalent to 0% sanity) player is trapped in nightmare and game is over.
Defeating enemies reduces fear and activating temporary safe zones will reduce fear based on time spent within.
Encountering nightmares and some nightmare attacks will increase fear.
